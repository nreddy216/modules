#Lightning Talks

[**SIGN UP HERE**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nJaxf5Nb6ThHU920svHsXVRDwbv9ZkPcMmef111jy5k/edit?usp=sharing
)

Your goal is to create a 5-6 minute presentation on a topic that is useful to your fellow developer. We encourage you to dive right in with a small demo that you created! Please also create a brief readme outlining your findings and any helpful resources you discover in your research.

- What problem does this technology solve?
- How do you use it? Is there a "cheatsheet" you found or made that others can reference?
- What did you build?

Lightning talks will be on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon next week.
